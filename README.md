Helios
======

helios is an e-commerce package which holds individual apps for the creation of
web shops.

It provides a basic functionality on which one can further build on. It's not
meant as a full blown handle-all solution.

It spawned the development of [django-currencies](https://github.com/panosl/django-currencies)
which was initially part of Helios.
